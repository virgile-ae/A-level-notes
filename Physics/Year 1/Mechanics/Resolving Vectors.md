## What is a Vector

| Scalar | Vector |
|-|-|
| Mass | Force |
| Speed | Velocity |
| Distance | Displacement |
| Temperature | Momentum |
| Density | |

* **Scalar**: only has a magnitude.
* **Vector**: has a magnitude and a direction.
* Vectors are represented using a straight line or an arrow.
    * The arrow indicates direction.
    * The length of the arrow indicates magnitude.
* A **resultant** vector is made up of multiple **component** vectors.
* $\Sigma$ means resultant e.g. $\Sigma F$ is resultant force.

## Equilibrium

* When a body is in equilibrium it will either:
    * Be at rest.
    * Move with constant linear and rotational velocity.
* Conditions required for equilibrium:
    * Resultant forces on the body must be zero.
    * The principle of moments must apply about any point on the body.
* **Principle of moments**: when a body is balanced, the total clockwise moment about a point equals the total anticlockwise moment about the same point.
