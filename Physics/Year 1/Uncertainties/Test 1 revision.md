## Measurements, Uncertainties and Errors

* **Random error** is when measurements vary by different amounts due to unpredictable circumstances.
* **Systematic error** is when measurements differ from the true value by a consistent amount each
time.
* **Precision** is how close measurements are to each other and the mean.
* **Accuracy** is how close a measurement is to the true value.
* **Repeatable** is when the original experimenter repeats the investigation using the same method
and gets the same results.
* **Reproducible** is when someone else repeats the investigation and the same results are obtained.
* **Resolution** is the smallest change in a quantity being measured that gives a change in the reading.
* The uncertainty of lengths is the precision.
* The uncertainty of all other measurements is half the precision.
* $\text{absolute uncertainty} \space(\Delta a)=\frac{\text{range}} 2$
* $\text{relative uncertainty} \space (\epsilon a)=\frac{\text{absolute uncertainty}}{\text{calculated value}}$
* $a = b ± c \Rightarrow ∆a = ∆b + ∆c$
* $a=bc \Rightarrow \Delta a =\Delta b+\Delta c$
* $a=b^c\Rightarrow \Delta a=c\cdot\Delta b$
* All of these equations also work for relative uncertainty.

### Resolving Vectors

* Vectors can be resolved into vertical and horizontal components.
