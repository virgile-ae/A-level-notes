* **Ohmic conductor**: any conductor for which current is directly proportional to potential difference under constant physical conditions.
* **Resistance**: a measure of how well a component resists the flow of current.

* **Threshold voltage**: the point after which resistance decreases.
* For diodes, this is 0.6V.
* When testing a diode, you must include a safety resistor to avoid breaking the diode.

## Thermistor (ohmic)

![Untitled](Physics/Year%201/Electricity/Electricity%20Summary/Untitled%203.png)

* Thermistors are ohmic conductors.
* When they heat up, their resistance decreases.

* LDRs are also ohmic conductors.
* When they are exposed to light, their resistance decreases.
