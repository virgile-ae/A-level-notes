## Power

**Power** is the rate of energy transfer.

$$
P=\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta t}=\frac{\Delta W}{\Delta t}
$$

| Symbol | Quantity | Unit |
| |  | |
| $P$ | Power | $W$ |
| $\Delta E$ | Change in energy transferred | $J$ |
| $\Delta W$ | Work done | $J$ |
| $\Delta t$ | Change in time | $s$ |

$$
P=Fv
$$

| Symbol | Quantity | Unit |
| |  | |
| $P$ | Power | $W$ |
| $F$ | Force | $N$ |
| $v$ | Velocity | $ms^{-1}$ |

## Efficiency

**Energy efficiency** is a measure of how usefully energy is used by a device.

$$
\text{efficiency}=\frac{\text{useful work output}}{\text{energy supplied}}=\frac{\text{useful power output}}{\text{power input}}
$$

The maximum efficiency is 1 as useful energy is always smaller than the energy supplied.

## Engine Power

### Moving at Constant Speed and Height

* All the resistive forces (friction, air resistances, etc.) are equal and opposite to the motive force.
* The work done by the engine is lost to the surroundings (as heat, sound, etc.)

$$
\text{power}_\text{engine}=\text{force}_\text{resistive}\times \text{velocity}
$$

### Moving and Gaining Speed

* The motive force from the engine exceeds the resistive forces. There is an positive net force, causing acceleration.
* The work done by the engine is the sum of the energy lost to surroundings and the gain in kinetic energy due to the increase in speed.

$$
\text{power}_\text{engine}=\text{force}_\text{resistive}\times\text{velocity}+\text{KE gain per second}
$$

### Moving and Gaining Height

* If we are driving up an incline, we gain height and GPE.
* The work done by the engine is the sum of the energy lost to the surroundings and the gain in GPE.

$$
\text{power}_\text{engine}=\text{force}_\text{resistive}\times\text{velocity}+\text{GPE gain per second}
$$
