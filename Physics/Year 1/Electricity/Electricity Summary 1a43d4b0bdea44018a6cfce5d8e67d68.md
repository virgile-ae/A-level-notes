## Charge

* **Charge** is a property of matter.
* Charge is transferred through charge carriers (commonly electrons, but also mobile ions).
* Charge is represented by $Q$ and is measured in Coulombs.
* **Elementary charge**: the charge of a proton or an electron.

### Charging by Friction

* When two objects rub against each other, electrons are transferred between them, causing them both to become charged.

### Charging by Induction

* When a charged object is near a neutral object, the charges in the neutral object will separate due to the charge of the charged object causing the neutral object to become slightly charged.
* This leads to the two objects being slightly attracted to each other.

### Charging by Conduction

* When a charged object touches a neutral object, charge will be transferred from the charged object to the neutral object.
* This causes the charged object to become less charged and the neutral object to become more charged.

## Current

* **Current**: the rate of flow of charge.
* Current flows from positive to negative.
* Electron flow is from negative to positive.

$$
I=\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}
$$

$$
\#e=\frac{\Delta Q}e
$$

Where

* $\#e$ is number of electrons.
* $\Delta Q$ is change in charge.
* $e$ is the elementary charge.

$$
I=qnvA
$$

Where

* $I$ is current.
* $q$ is the charge of the charge carrier (usually the elementary charge $e$).
* $n$ is the number of charge carriers.
* $v$ is the velocity of the charge carriers.
* $A$ is the cross-sectional area of the wire.

* Setup the circuit shown above.
* For the diode experiment, you must include a safety resistor.
* Change the potential difference across the components from zero to the maximum available from the power supply.
* Measure the current for each potential difference.
* Note the precision of the meters.
* Repeat readings and take a mean value.
* Plot a graph of I (on the y-axis) against V.

## Ohmic Conductors

* **Ohmic conductor**: any conductor for which current is directly proportional to potential difference under constant physical conditions.
* **Resistance**: a measure of how well a component resists the flow of current.

$$
R=\frac VI
$$

### Diode

![Untitled](Physics/Year%201/Electricity/Electricity%20Summary%201a43d4b0bdea44018a6cfce5d8e67d68/Untitled%201.png)

* **Threshold voltage**: the point after which resistance decreases.
* For diodes, this is 0.6V.
* When testing a diode, you must include a safety resistor to avoid breaking the diode.

### Thermistor (ohmic)

![Untitled](Physics/Year%201/Electricity/Electricity%20Summary%201a43d4b0bdea44018a6cfce5d8e67d68/Untitled%203.png)

* Thermistors are ohmic conductors.
* When they heat up, their resistance decreases.

* LDRs are also ohmic conductors.
* When they are exposed to light, their resistance decreases.

### Resistance of Wires

Features which affect the resistance of wires

* Material → resistivity
* Length
* Cross-sectional area

$$
R=\frac{\rho L}A
$$

| Symbol | Quantity | Unit |
| |  | |
| $R$ | resistance | Ω |
| $\rho$ | resistivity | Ωm |
| $L$ | length | m |
| $A$ | area | m² |

## Electromotive Force (EMF)

* **Electromotive force (EMF)** is the energy per unit charge transferred from chemical energy to electrical energy by the supply.
* **Superconductors** have a resistivity of 0 when lowered below their critical temperature.

## Kirchhoff’s Laws

### Kirchhoff’s Current Law

$$
\Sigma I=0
$$

| Symbol | Quantity | Unit |
| |  | |
| $\Sigma I$ | Sum of currents | $A$ |

$\text{total current into a junction}=\text{total current out of a junction}$

### Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law

$$
\Sigma\epsilon=\Sigma v
$$

| Symbol | Quantity | Unit |
| |  | |
| $\Sigma \epsilon$ | Sum of emfs | $V$ |
| $\Sigma v$ | Sum of potential drops | $V$ |

$\text{sum of emfs in a loop}=\text{sum of potential drops}$

A potential divider

* A **potentiometer** is a type of potential divider.
    * They can measure a larger range of voltages as you can choose any ratio between the resistors.
* A **potential divider** is a type of circuit which an change the potential difference across a component.

## Internal Resistance

$$
\epsilon=I(R+r)
$$

| Symbol | Quantity | Unit |
| |  | |
| $\epsilon$ | EMF | $V$ |
| $I$ | Current | $A$ |
| $R$ | Load resistance | $\Omega$ |
| $r$ | Internal resistance | $\Omega$ |

$$
P=\frac{\epsilon^2}{(r+R)^2}R
$$

![Untitled](Untitled%2010.png)

(From $P=I^2R$ and $\epsilon=I(R+r)$)

The power to the external resistor ($R$) is greatest when $r=R$.

## Alternating Currents

* The root mean square voltage ($V_{RMS}$) is
    * The square root of the mean of the squares of values of the voltage in one cycle.
    * The equivalent dc voltage that produces the same power.

$$
V_{RMS}=\frac{V_0}{\sqrt{2}}
$$

$$
I_{RMS}=\frac{I_0}{\sqrt{2}}
$$
