## Charge

* **Charge** is a property of matter.
* Charge is transferred through charge carriers (commonly electrons, but also mobile ions).
* Charge is represented by $Q$ and is measured in Coulombs.
* **Elementary charge**: the charge of a proton or an electron.

### Charging by Friction

* When two objects rub against each other, electrons are transferred between them, causing them both to become charged.

### Charging by Induction

* When a charged object is near a neutral object, the charges in the neutral object will separate due to the charge of the charged object causing the neutral object to become slightly charged.
* This leads to the two objects being slightly attracted to each other.

### Charging by Conduction

* When a charged object touches a neutral object, charge will be transferred from the charged object to the neutral object.
* This causes the charged object to become less charged and the neutral object to become more charged.

## Current

* **Current**: the rate of flow of charge.
* Current flows from positive to negative.
* Electron flow is from negative to positive.

* Setup the circuit shown above.
* For the diode experiment, you must include a safety resistor.
* Change the potential difference across the components from zero to the maximum available from the power supply.
* Measure the current for each potential difference.
* Note the precision of the meters.
* Repeat readings and take a mean value.
* Plot a graph of I (on the y-axis) against V.
