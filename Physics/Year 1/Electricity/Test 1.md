## 3.5.1.1 Basics of Electricity

* **Electric current** is the rate of flow of charge.
* **Potential difference** is the work done per unit charge.
* $I=\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}$
* $V=\frac WQ$
* **Resistance** is defined as $R=\frac VI$

## 3.5.1.2 Current-voltage Characteristics

* For ohmic conductor: current is directly proportional to voltage.
* For diode: no/very low resistance after 0.6V.
* For filament lamp: resistance increases with current.
* **Ohmâ€™s law**: $I \propto V$ for ohmic conductors under constantl physical conditions.
* Ammeters have zero resistance.
* Voltmeters have infinite resistance.

## 3.5.1.3 Resistivity

* **Resistivity** of a material is defined as $\rho=\frac{RA}L$
    * $R$ is resistance.
    * $A$ is cross sectional area.
    * $L$ is length.
* Increasing temperature
    * Electrons have more kinetic energy
    * More energy transferred to ions on collision
    * Ions vibrate more due to increased KE
    * Vibration causes more frequent collisions
    * Current lower due to increased resistance
* Resistance of thermistors decreases with temperature.
* **Superconductivity** is a property of certain materials which have zero resistivity at and below a critical temperature which depends of the material.
* Uses of superconductors
    * Strong magnetic fields
    * Reduction of energy loss in transmission of electric power
