The long run aggregate supply curve.

![Long run equilibrium.](Economics/Macroeconomics/LRAS/Untitled%201.png)

Long run equilibrium.

* On the LRAS curve, all costs of production are variable (inc. wages).
* **LRAS** is a measure of a country’s potential output (the output at full employment).

## Full Employment Level of Output

* Real GDP fluctuates with the level of unemployment.
    * In the expansion phase, unemployment drops as firms hire to increase output.
    * In the contraction phase, unemployment rises as firms cut back production.
* The **full employment level of output** is the level of real GDP at which the economy experiences full employment.
* **Full employment** doesn’t mean that all resources (inc. labour) are employed to the greatest possible extent, as there is still some unemployment, known as the **natural rate of unemployment**.
* This is because, for example, at any time, there are some people in between jobs, some who are moving to a different area, some who are training to get a better job, some who are temporarily out of work. Therefore, there are always some people who are unemployed.

## Why is LRAS Straight

In the long run, AS is independent of the price level and is determined by the quality, quantity, and efficiency (QQE) of factors of production, so the LRAS curve is vertical.
