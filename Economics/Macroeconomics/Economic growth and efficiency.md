* For economic growth to occur, there must be an increase in the quantity of one of the factors of production or the factors need to be used more efficiently.
* Efficiency is important as less resources are needed to produce each good so more goods can be produced.

## Encouraging Efficiency

* Ensure competition: firms will reduce costs to maximise profits and stay competitive.
* Protection of property rights (i.e. the right to be able to be the only one to produce the product you invented): security increases confidence and encourages investment.
* Efficient capital market: access to loans to encourage investment.
* In a communist society, there is a lack of efficiency as the government is the only supplier so it isnâ€™t motivated to cut costs to keep profits high.

## Productivity

* **Productivity** is the quantity of output produced for each hour of work of the working population.
* $\text{productivity} = \frac{\text{real GDP}}{\text{total hours worked}}$

## Growth

* **Actual growth** is the percentage change in GDP. It is when the economy is actually producing more goods and services.

* **Potential growth** is a change in the productive potential of the economy over time.

* The **value of GDP** is the monetary value of GDP at prices of the day. It is the nominal figure and is calculated by $\text{volume} \times \text{current price level}$.
* The **volume of GDP** is GDP adjusted for inflation.
* Real values can be described as the volume of national income (i.e. the size of the basket of goods), whereas nominal values represent the value of the national income (i.e. the monetary cost of this basket of goods).
