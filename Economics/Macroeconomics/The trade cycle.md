* The **trade cycle** is fluctuations in the growth of real output, consisting of alternating periods of expansion (increasing real output) and contraction.
* Some businesses benefit from economic downturn, such as:
    * Value retailers (e.g. Aldi, Lidl).
    * Fast food outlets (e.g. Domino’s, Subway).
    * Domestic holidays (B&B, holiday cottages).

## Phases of the Trade Cycle

| Phase | Growth | Unemployment | Confidence | Demand | Inflation | Wages |
|--|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| Recovery | High | Decreasing | High | Increasing | Increasing | Increasing |
| Boom | High | Low | High | High | High | High |
| Slump | Low/none | Increasing | Low | Decreasing | Decreasing | Decreasing |
| Recession | Low/none | High | Low | Low | Low | Low |

* Recovery/expansion: an expansion occurs when there is positive growth in real GDP. This marks the beginning of a new economic cycle.
* Boom: a boom represents the cycle’s maximum real GDP, and marks the end of the expansion. Government budget $\uparrow$ as tax revenue $\uparrow$ and expenditure $\downarrow$.
* Recession: when real GDP falls for more than six months (two quarters) it is a recession. Some firms may go out of business.
* Slump: a slump is the cycles minimum GDP and the end of the recession.

## Long Term Growth Trend

* **Long term growth trend** or **potential growth** shows how output grows over time when cyclical fluctuations are removed.
* **Output gap** is $\text{actual GDP} - \text{potential GDP}$.

## Causes of Growth

### Land

* Discovery of new resources (particularly in LEDCs).
* e.g. Saudi Arabia experienced increased growth rates due to discovery of oil.

### Labour

* Increased size of workforce due to immigration and increased participation. This increases the total production capacity, however job opportunities are needed.
* Increased quality of workforce due to education.
    * Increased productivity.
    * More skilled workers so structural unemployment (mismatch between demand and workforce) is less likely as they have more occupational mobility (i.e. can switch between jobs).
    * Increased entrepreneurship and innovation.

### Capital

* Sustained investment leads to new technology and increased productivity.
* More machines are bought/used so more goods can be produced.

### Enterprise

* Entrepreneurs drive innovation by developing new products/services/tech which leads to the growth of new industries and increased economic activity.
* This creates jobs and encourages competition.
* Governments offer tax benefits and grants to encourage this.
* However, if taxes/unemployment benefits are too high, there’s little incentive to work.

### Technological Change

* Increased productivity and efficiency.
* Encourages innovation.
* Reduced costs leads to increased profits.

## Benefits and Drawbacks of Economic Growth

### Consumers

| Benefits | Drawbacks |
|-|-|
| Lower prices and higher quality goods due to competition. | Increased inequality. |
| Wealth effect | Inflation |

### Firms

| Benefits | Drawbacks |
|-|-|
| Improved business confidence so more demand and investment. | Firms that sell value/inferior goods get fewer clients. |

### The Government

| Benefits | Drawbacks |
|-|-|
| Improved tax revenue. | Increased expectations on what they should provide. |
| Can help reduce budget deficit/debt. | |

### Current and Future Living Standards

| Benefits | Drawbacks |
|-|-|
| Lower poverty levels | Rise in inequality. |
| Greater access to goods and services. | Environmental degradation and depletion of natural resources. |
| Increased government spending so better public services. | Rapid urbanization so overcrowding in cities, rural depopulation, and urban sprawl. |
