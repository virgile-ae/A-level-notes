> Movements along SRAS are caused by changes in price.
> Shifts of the SRAS are caused by changes in costs of production.
* **Cost-push** is when increased production cost is passed on to consumers.
* **Demand-pull** is when increased demand increases prices.

## Causes of SRAS Shifts

### Change in Wages

* Due to change in minimum wage or labour unions.
* Wages are a factor of production so increased wages lead to left shift and vice-versa.

### Changes in Non-labour Prices

* e.g. oil, equipment, capital goods, land input.
* These are also factors of production so increased cost leads to left shift and vice-versa.

### Changes in Business Tax

* Business tax is treated as a cost of production.
* Increased tax leads to left shift and vice-versa.

### Changes in Subsidies

* This has the opposite effect to taxes.
* Increased subsidies leads to left shift and vice-versa.

### Changes in exchange Rates

* SPICED leads to right shift as cost of production (cost of imported materials) decreases.
* WIDEC leads to left shift as cost of production increases.
* Inflation in the UK experienced after Brexit was caused by a fall in the pound which increased import prices and lead to cost push inflation.

### Supply Shocks

* A **supply shock** is an event with a sudden and strong impact on SRAS.
* Beneficial supply shocks (e.g. very good weather) leads to right shift and vice-versa.
