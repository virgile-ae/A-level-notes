## The Multiplier Effect

* An increase in demand leads to an injection of more income leading to economic growth.
* More jobs are created, increasing spending and the average income.
* The multiplier effect refers to how an initial increase in AD leads to a larger increase in national income as ‘one person’s spending is another person’s income’.
* It is also possible to have a ‘reverse’ multiplier (i.e. a withdrawal from the circular flow of income will lead to a greater decrease in real GDP).

## The Multiplier Ratio

* The **multiplier ratio** is the ratio of the rise in national income (i.e. rise in real GDP) to the initial rise in AD.
* To calculate the multiplier ratio, you need to look at what fraction of income is spent on leakages (i.e. imports, savings, tax). The remaining income is spent on consumption.
* The **marginal propensity to consume (MPC)** is the fraction of additional income spent on consumption of domestically produced goods and services.
* The **marginal propensity to save (MPS)** is the fraction of additional income saved.
* The **marginal propensity to tax (MPT)** is the fraction of additional income taxed.
* The **marginal propensity to import (MPM)** is the fraction of additional income spent on imported goods and services.
* The **marginal propensity to withdraw (MPW)** is $\text{MPS + MPT + MPM}$.

$$
\text{MPW + MPC} = 1
$$

The formula to calculate the value of the multiplier is

$$
\frac 1 {1-\text{MPC}}\equiv\frac1{\text{MPW}}
$$

To find the change in GDP, use the equation

$$
\text{injection}\cdot\text{multiplier}=\text{impact on GDP}
$$

* The multiplier value is greater when
    * The economy has plenty of spare capacity (so that it can meet the rise in demand).
    * MPM and MPT are low.
    * MPC is high.
* The multiplier value is smaller when
    * The economy is close to full capacity.
    * MPM and MPT are high.
    * Higher inflation causes rising interest rates which decreases demand.
