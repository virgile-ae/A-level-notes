## Economic Growth

* **Economic growth** is the increase in the real quantity of goods and services produced over a period of time (typically a year).
* **Economic contraction** is the decrease in the real quantity of goods and services producer over a period of time.
* **Output** is goods and services.
* The key measure is GDP.
* The objective is for strong, sustained, and sustainable growth.
* **Sustainable growth** is when the way that the economy is growing today can be continued over time.
* Effects of economic growth include
    * Increased tax.
    * Better public provisions.
    * Income and spending increase.

## Low Unemployment

* **Unemployment** is people of working age who are actively looking for a job but aren’t employed.
* The objective is for low unemployment.
* High unemployment is an indicator of poor economic performance.
* Unemployment is bad as it is a waste of resources (labour), and the government has to spend (more) money on benefits.

## Low and Stable Rate of Inflation

* **Inflation** is a sustained increase in the general price level (the average prices of goods/services).
* The objective is a low and stable rate of inflation. The UK’s target is 2%.
* If inflation is too low, people will never buy stuff as prices will continually decrease.
* If inflation is too high, purchasing power is eroded (people can buy less stuff). It also leads to more instability.

## Balance of Payments Equilibrium

* **Balance of payments** measures the UK’s record of economic activities with other countries.
* **Current account** measures flows of money in and out of the country as payments for goods, services, investments, and other financial transfers.
* **Surplus** is when exports > imports.
* **Deficit** is when exports < imports.
* **Equilibrium** is when exports = imports.
* The objective is for surplus or equilibrium.
* Deficits have to be funded (often by borrowing).

## Greater Distribution of Income

* The objective is for a fair distribution of income.
* Studies suggest increasing equality leads to
    * Increased economic growth
    * Improved living standards
    * A happier society
* To encourage this, policies are designed to encourage horizontal equity.
* **Horizontal equity**: equal pay for equal work, equal access to opportunities.

## How is the Performance of an Economy Measured?

Use the acronym ‘TIGERS’:
* **T**rade (i.e. balance of payments)
* **I**nflation
* (Economic) **G**rowth
* **E**mployment
* **R**edistribution of income
* **S**tability
