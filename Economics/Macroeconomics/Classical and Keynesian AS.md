**Inflationary gap/positive output gap**

* After SRAS or AD shifts, there will be either a recessionary or an inflationary output gap.
* However, the assumption of wage and price flexibility in the long run allows the economy to automatically come back to the long-run equilibrium level of output (although the price level may change).

## Keynesian view

* Keynes thought wages were sticky downwards (i.e. they don’t fall) because
    * Minimum wage, unions, labour contracts.
    * Product prices won’t fall.
* Once you reach LRAS (i.e. Yfe), any increases in AD will only cause inflation (and not increase output).
* Increases in national income caused by spending is inflationary.

### Spare Capacity

* The horizontal part of the AS curve shows that there is unemployment and spare capacity.
* **Spare capacity** is unused physical capital (i.e. a negative output gap).
