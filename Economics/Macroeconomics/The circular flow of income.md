## The Circular Flow of Income

![Untitled](Economics/Macroeconomics/Aggregate%20demand/Untitled.png)

* An **injection** is money which enters the economy.
* A **withdrawal** or **leakage** is money which leaves the economy.

### Linking Injections and Leakages

* Banks link *savings* and *investment*.
* The open economy links *imports* and *exports*.
* The government links *taxes* and *government spending*.

### Size of the Circular Flow

* Injections are $I+G+X$.
* Leakages are $S+T+M$.
* When $I+G+X > S+T+M$, there is economic growth and a rise in national income.
    * More goods are purchased.
    * Firms increase production.
    * Unemployment falls.
    * Household income increases.
* When $I+G+X < S+T+M$, there is economic decline and a fall in national income.
* When $I+G+X=S+T+M$, there is equilibrium.

## National Income and Expenditure

\text{national expenditure = national output}-\text{national income}

* **National output** is the total output of goods and services in the economy.
* **National income** is the total income earned by the economy.
* **National expenditure** is the total level of spending in the economy.

### Income and Wealth

* **Income** is a flow of money going to factors of production.
