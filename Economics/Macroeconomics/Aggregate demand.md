## Aggregate Demand

$$
\ce{AD = C + I + G + (X-M)}
$$
* **Aggregate demand** ($\text{AD}$) is the total quantity of aggregate output (or real GDP) that all buyers in an economy want to buy at different possible price levels, ceteris paribus.
* **Consumption** ($\text{C}$) is consumer spending on goods and services.
* **Investment** ($\text{I}$) is spending by firms on capital goods (e.g. new equipment and buildings) as well as working capital (e.g. stocks and work in progress).
* **Government spending** ($\text{G}$) is spending by the government on providing goods and services, generally *public* (non-rivalrous, non-excludable) and *merit* (rivalrous, excludable e.g. healthcare) goods, *wages* of public sector workers and *investment goods* (e.g. roads, schools). *Transfer payments* (e.g. pensions, jobseeker’s allowances) aren’t included.
* **Net exports** $(\text{X}-\text{M})$ is exports - imports. The UK has a large trade deficit but this is the least significant part of AD.
* The **aggregate demand curve** shows the relationship between the aggregate output buyers want to buy (i.e. real GDP demanded), and the economy’s price level, ceteris paribus.

## The Trade Cycle

## Why is the AD Curve downward Sloping

### Real Balance Effect

* As the price level decreases, the purchasing power of income increases.
* People are richer so they are more likely to spend.
* Consumption increases as price levels have changed.
* Leads to an expansion of AD so real GDP increases.

### Trade Effect

* A fall in price level leads to exports being more competitive and imports being less competitive.
* If exports become competitive, there will be a greater demand for exports so revenue from exports increases.
* Imports become less competitive as domestic goods and services are more competitive so spending on imports decreases.

### Interest Rate Effect

* As the price levels decrease, interest rates decrease to meet an inflation target.
* This causes
    * Increased consumption.
    * Increased investment (cost of borrowing is lower).
    * Decreased value of exchange rate.
    * Increased net exports (WIDEC).

## Shifts of the AD Curve

* Movements along the AD curve (i.e. expansions, contractions) are caused by changes in the price level.
* Shifts of the AD curve are caused by the determinants of aggregate demand (C, I, G, (X-M))

### Interest Rates

* Increase (left shift)
    * Increased cost of borrowing
    * Businesses must decreased investment financed by borrowing.
    * Decrease (right shift)
    * Decrease cost of borrowing.
    * Increased incentive to borrow money to invest.

### Business confidence/Animal Spirits

* This is how optimistic firms are about future sales and economic activity.
* High (right shift)
    * Expectation of future profit, and high demand.
    * Businesses will increase investment to meet level of future demand.
* Low (left shift)
    * Expectation of low profit and demand.
    * No incentive to invest to increase capacity.

### Business Tax

* Increase (left shift)
    * After tax profit and retained profit decreases.
    * Less potential to invest.
* Decrease (right shift)
    * After tax profit and retained profit increases.
    * More potential to invest.
* Example: corporation tax increased from 19% to 25% on 1st April in the UK (for profits >250k)

### Technological Improvements

* Improved (right shift)
    * Increased production and efficiency.
    * Increased investment and profit.

### Government and Relations

* Lack of access to credit (left shift)
    * Small businesses find it difficult to borrow money.
    * Decreased investment.
* No laws securing property rights (left shift)
    * Low confidence.
    * Decreased investment.
* Too many regulations (left shift)
    * Too difficult to invest/run a business.
    * Decreased investment.
* Tax cuts and grants (right shift)
    * Encourages investment.

### Spare Capacity

* Low (right shift)
    * Low unused factors of production.
    * Increased investment to increase production capacity.
* High (left shift)
    * Lots of unused factors of production.
    * Decreased investment.

### Demand for Exports

* Increases (right shift)
    * Increased investment to keep up with increased demand.
    * Knock on effect, encouraging other firms to invest.
