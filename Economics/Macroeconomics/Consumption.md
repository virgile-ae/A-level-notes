* **Consumption** is the total planned spending by households on consumer goods and services produced within the economy.
    * It is the largest component of aggregate demand (60% of total AD).
* **Disposable income** (Y) is the money consumers have left to spend after taxes are taken and state benefits are added.
    * It is impacted by government tax.
    * It is the most important factor in determining the level of consumption.
* **Saving** is the proportion of disposable income that is not used for consumption.
    * It is a withdrawal from the circular flow of income.
    * Higher consumption leads to decreased savings.
* **Marginal propensity to consume** is the willingness for households to spend any extra income that they earn.
    * MPC is usually positive but less than 1 (i.e. an increase in income increases spending but spending doesn’t increase by as much as income).
    * Some people have an MPC > 1 as they use borrowing or savings to fulfil the demand for goods which is higher than their increase in income.
    * Poorer people tend to have a higher MPC as they are likely to spend more of their increase in income.
    * Richer people tend to save any increase in income.
* The **average propensity to consume** is the average amount spent on consumption out of total income.
    * In an industrialized country, the economy’s APC is likely < 1 as people save some of their earnings.
* **Marginal propensity to save** is how much of an increase in income is saved.
    * $\text{marginal propensity to save} = \frac{\Delta\text{savings}}{\Delta\text{income}}$
* **Average propensity to save** is the average amount saved out of income.
    * $\text{average propensity to save}=\frac{\text{total savings}}{ \text{total income}}$

## Factors that Affect Consumption

### Disposable Income

* Increase (right shift)
    * (Due to a) cut in the marginal rate of income tax.
    * Increased real disposable income.
    * Increased marginal propensity to consume.
    * Increased consumption.

### Consumer Confidence

* **Consumer confidence** is how optimistic consumers are about their future income and the economy’s future.
* High (right shift)
    * Decreased unemployment.
    * Increased marginal propensity to consume.
    * Increased spending, decreased savings.
* Low (left shift)
    * Expectation of recession and high unemployment.
    * Decreased marginal propensity to consume.
    * Decreased spending, increased savings.
* Expectation of interest rates to increase, increases spending.

### Interest Rates

* **Interest rates** are the cost of borrowing and the reward for saving expressed as a percentage of the money saved/borrowed.
* Increase (left shift)
    * Increased cost of borrowing $\rightarrow$ low incentive to borrow $\rightarrow$ decreased consumption.
    * Increased return on savings $\rightarrow$ high incentive to save $\rightarrow$ decreased consumption.
    * Increased mortgage repayment $\rightarrow$ decreased disposable income $\rightarrow$ decreased consumption.
* Decrease (right shift)
    * Decreased cost of borrowing $\rightarrow$ high incentive to borrow $\rightarrow$ increased consumption.
    * Decreased return on savings $\rightarrow$ low incentive to save $\rightarrow$ increased consumption.
    * Decreased mortgage repayment $\rightarrow$ increased disposable income $\rightarrow$ increased consumption.

### Availability of Credit

* This is the maximum amount of credit a borrower is allowed to have.
* Low (left shift)
    * Decreased borrowing
    * Decreased impact of low interest rates (as people can’t borrow).
    * Decreased consumption and marginal propensity to consume.

### Wealth Effect

* **Wealth** is a stock of assets.
* Increase (right shift)
    * Increased consumer wealth (due to e.g. increased house/stock prices).
    * Increased confidence.
    * Increased spending and marginal propensity to consume.
* Increase in house prices (right shift)
    * House prices can be used as collateral in new loans.
    * Increased house prices leads to more/larger loans given out.

### Inflation Expectations

* **Inflation** is the sustained increase in the general price level.
* Increase (right shift):
    * Increased consumption (as goods will be more expensive in the future).
    * Increased marginal propensity to consume.

## Savings

* **Saving** is the proportion of disposable income that is not used for consumption.
    * It is a withdrawal from the circular flow of income.
    * Higher consumption leads to decreased savings.
* The **Household Saving Ratio** shows the proportion of household income that is saved.
    * If it is too high, there may be insufficient spending.
        * This is beneficial if the economy is growing too quickly (inflation/hyperinflation).
        * This is problematic if the economy is growing slowly or is in recession.
    * A low savings ratio means that consumer spending may be too high and there may be insufficient funds for investment.
* The saving ratio is likely to rise during a recession
    * Low confidence and less disposable income (due to high unemployment).
    * Decreased spending.
* In the short run, low savings leads to increased standards of living.
* In the long run, low savings leads to decreased investment, economic growth and welfare.
* Sudden changes in the savings ratio indicates future changes in spending, AD and inflation.
    * Increase in savings ratio shows low confidence.
    * Decrease in savings ratio shows high confidence and spending, and an increased price level.
