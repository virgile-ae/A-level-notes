* **Exports** are good and services sold abroad.
    * Exporting generates revenue for the domestic economy so it is an injection into the circular flow of income.
* **Imports** are goods and services purchased from abroad.
    * Importing leads to expenditure for the domestic economy so it is a leakage from the circular flow of income.
* $\text{net exports} = \text{sterling value of total exports}-\text{sterling value of total imports}$
* The UK is traditionally a net importer of goods and services which has a negative impact on aggregate demand.

## Factors that Affect exchange Rates

### The exchange Rates

* The **exchange rate** is the price of one currency in terms of another.
* Rise (left shift)
    * Strong Pound, Imports Dearer, Exports Cheaper (SPICED).
* Fall (right shift)
    * Weak pound, Imports Cheaper, Exports Dearer (WIDEC).

### National Income

* **Marginal propensity to import** is the proportion of additional income spent on imported goods and services.
* Changes in real income abroad
    * Country A has links to country B.
    * Increased national income in B, so people are richer.
    * Increased marginal propensity to import (as demand increases).
    * Exports in A increase.
* Changes in real income at home
    * If there is a boom in the UK, the marginal propensity to import in the UK increases.
    * Increased import expenditure.
    * Reducing X-M

### Changes in the Level of Trade Protectionism

* **Trade protectionism** is restrictions to free international trade imposed by governments.
* e.g. tariffs, quotas, and sanctions.
* Tariffs, quotas and sanctions on UK exports (left shift)
    * Prevents access to international markets.
    * Decreased UK export revenue.
* Low levels of protectionism abroad (right shift)
    * Easier to access international markets.
    * Increased export revenue.

### Relative Inflation Levels

* Relatively low inflation (left shift)
    * Decreased demands for exports.
    * Decreased export revenue.

### State of the World Economy

* If the UKâ€™s main export country is doing well
    * Increased UK exports
    * Increased net trade

### Changes in Non-price Factors

* If UK goods have a higher quality and design
    * Increased foreign demand and exports.
    * Decreased imports as people will buy the British good instead of the foreign goods.
* If UK goods are well marketed
    * People will have a stronger desire to buy British goods.
    * Increased net exports.
