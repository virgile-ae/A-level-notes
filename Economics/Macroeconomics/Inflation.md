* **Inflation** is the sustained rise in the general price level over time.
* **Deflation** is when the average price level in an economy is falling.
* **Disinflation** is the falling rate of inflation.
* **Stagflation** is when there is cost push inflation, leading to high inflation, falling real GDP, and high unemployment.

## Inflation

### Cost Push Causes

Cost-push inflation occurs when firms respond to rising costs by increasing their prices to protect their profit margins.

* Increased prices of raw materials.
* Increased cost of labour (due to unions/minimum wage).
* Increased indirect tax (increases the costs of goods e.g. VAT, carbon tax).
* Depreciation in exchange rate (increased cost of imports).

### Demand Pull Causes

* A depreciation in the exchange rate (low price of exports).
* Decreased interest rates.
* Decreased tax.
* Increased consumer confidence (inc. wealth effect).
* Faster growth rates of other countries.
* Fiscal stimulus (through decreased tax or increased gov. spending).

### Consequences

#### On Consumers

* Decreased purchasing power.
* Increased cost of living (people may struggle to afford basic necessities, affects those on low incomes the most).
* Savers are worse off as the value of their savings decreases.
* Borrowers are better off as the real value of debt decreases.

#### On Firms

* Workers demand higher wages.
* Decreased investment due to higher interest rates.
* Firms may be less price competitive (to maintain profit margins).
* Decreased business confidence.
* **Menu costs** are costs incurred by firms when they have to change their prices.

However if wages are fixed while there is inflation, the real value of payments decreases.

#### On Workers

* Firms may fire workers to cut costs.
* Decreased real income.

#### On the Government

* Increased state pension and welfare payments due to increased cost of living.

## Deflation

### Demand Side Causes (malignant deflation)

* Deep fall in AD, causing a persistant recession/depression.
* A large negative output gap.
* Global economic slowdown/recession.
* A rise in the exchange rate.
* Decline in domestic and international asset prices (wealth effect).

### Supply Side Causes (benign deflation)

* Improved productivity.
* Technological advances.
* Significant fall in wage rates.
* High exchange rate.

### Consequences

* Decreased consumption as prices are expected to fall.
* Real value of debt increases.
* Real cost of borrowing increases.
* Lower profit margins due to decreased prices.
* Low confidence due to negative wealth effect.
* Income redistribution from debtors to creditors (although debtors may default).
* Exporters are more competitive (eventually).

## Hyperinflation

### Consequences

* Very weak currency.
* Rapidly increasing prices.
* Fast devaluation of currency.
* No savings which harms investment in the long run.
* Inflationary spiral
    * Increased spending to benefit from current lower prices (demand pull inflation).
    * Workers demand higher nominal wages (cost push inflation).
* People may resort to bartering.
* Businesses stop investing in productive activities and instead invest in assets that are believed to maintain their value as prices rise.
* Firms withhold goods from sale in the market.
* Lenders suffer massive losses as the real value of debt falls.

## Consumer Price Index (CPI)

* The **consumer price index (CPI)** refers to the weighted average of the prices of a basket of goods/services that the typical household in an economy buys, expressed as an index number for a given time period.
* It is used to measure inflation rate and cost of living.
* It is updated annually.

### Limitations

* Different demographics have different spending patterns (so the weighting for each type of good based on proportion of income spent on them is different for everyone).
* Slow to respond to new goods and services.
* Hard to make historical comparisons.
* Self recorded data may not be truthful.
* Small sample size.

### Alternatives to CPI

* RPI is the old way to measure inflation. It is similar to CPI but also includes mortgage interest payments and rent.
* RPIX is RPI without mortgage interest payment to get over the distorting effect that raising interest rates can have on the RPI. It is very similar to CPI.
* RIPY excludes mortgage interest payments and indirect tax.
