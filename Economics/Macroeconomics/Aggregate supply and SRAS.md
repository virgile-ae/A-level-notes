## Short-run and Long-run

* **Short-run** is a period of time when prices of resources are roughly constant or inflexible (i.e. they don’t change in response to supply and demand). This applies especially to wages (the price of labor).
* **Long-run** is a period of time when the prices of all resources (inc. labour) are flexible and change along with changes in the price level.
* Wages account for most of a firm’s costs of production so affect the quantity of output the most.
* Wages don’t change much over short periods of time due to
    * Labour contracts which fix wage rates for periods of time.
    * Minimum wage legislation fixes the lowest legally permissible wage.
    * Worker and labour unions resist wage cuts.
    * Wage cuts have negative effects on worker morale (so firms avoid them).

## Aggregate Supply

* **Aggregate supply** is the total quantity of goods and services produced in an economy (i.e. real GDP) over a particular time period at different price levels.
* **SRAS** shows the relationship between the price level and the quantity of real output produced by firms when resource prices are inflexible.

## Why Does SRAS Slope upwards

* Based on firm profitability.
* Increase in price level so output prices increase but resource prices stay the same so profit increases.
* Production is more profitable so firms increase production.

> There is an assumption that capital costs (i.e. costs of technology and production) are *constant*.

## Causes of SRAS Shifts

> Movements along SRAS are caused by changes in price.
> Shifts of the SRAS are caused by changes in costs of production.
* **Cost-push** is when increased production cost is passed on to consumers.
* **Demand-pull** is when increased demand increases prices.

### Change in Wages

* Due to change in minimum wage or labour unions.
* Wages are a factor of production so increased wages lead to left shift and vice-versa.

### Changes in Non-labour Prices

* e.g. oil, equipment, capital goods, land input.
* These are also factors of production so increased cost leads to left shift and vice-versa.

### Changes in Business Tax

* Business tax is treated as a cost of production.
* Increased tax leads to left shift and vice-versa.

### Changes in Subsidies

* This has the opposite effect to taxes.
* Increased subsidies leads to left shift and vice-versa.

### Changes in exchange Rates

* SPICED leads to right shift as cost of production (cost of imported materials) decreases.
* WIDEC leads to left shift as cost of production increases.
* Inflation in the UK experienced after Brexit was caused by a fall in the pound which increased import prices and lead to cost push inflation.

### Supply Shocks

* A **supply shock** is an event with a sudden and strong impact on SRAS.
* Beneficial supply shocks (e.g. very good weather) leads to right shift and vice-versa.
