* **Economic growth** is an increase in the the real quantity of goods and services produced over a period of time (usually a year), or real GDP. It measures the rate of change of a country’s output.
* **GDP** is the total value of goods and services produced in a country within a year. It is the key measure of economic growth.

## Short-run and Long-run Growth

* **Short-run economic growth** is the actual annual percentage change in real national output.
* **Long-run economic growth** is an increase in the potential productive capacity of the economy.

## Gross Domestic Product (GDP)

### Calculating GDP

* **National expenditure approach** is the sum of all spending to buy final goods and services produced in a country over a time period.
* **National income approach** is the sum of all income earned by factors of production that produce all goods and services within a country over a time period.
* **National output approach** is the value of all final goods and services produced in a country over a time period.

### Importance of GDP

* It shows us how much output the economy is producing/how much income it is making.
* It is important for the country as making more money means you can be more things which usually leads to a better standard of living.

### GDP as a Measure of Living Standards

* GDP can measure economic welfare and reflect changes in economic growth.
* Rising GDP is important as it is a direct way of cutting extreme poverty.
* Example
    * In 2022, China’s GDP was about $18.1 trillion, a 1,791% increase over 25 years.
    * Over the last 40 years, the number of those in extreme poverty has fallen by 800 million.
    * China achieved upper-middle-income status in 2010.

### Advantages of GDP

* Internationally comparable/standardized measure.
* Fairly simple measure, so low opportunity cost to governments.
* Requires less data than other measures, reducing the chances of inaccuracy.
* GDP can be refined into GDP per capita.

### Limitations of GDP

#### Gross National Income (GNI)

* GDP measures the value of production within a country’s borders however it does not consider the income earned by its citizens while operating outside of the country.
* **GNI** is the value of goods and services produced by a country over a period of time plus net income paid into the country by other countries for things such as dividends and interest payments.
* This means that it adds what a country earns from overseas investments and subtracts what foreigners earn in a country and send back home from GDP.

#### Inequality

* GDP ignores relative inequality so if there is an increase in GDP, only some of the population will benefit. This is particularly true for less developed countries.
* Living standards will be misrepresented by GDP as it doesn’t take into account income inequality.
* The **GINI coefficient** is used to measure the degree of inequality in a society. It provides a numerical value for inequality between 0 and 1 with 1 being very unequal and 0 being perfectly equal.
* *Example*: in the UK, GDP increased by 133% between 1977-2022 but the GINI coefficient increased from 0.25 to 0.35.
* *Importance*: some people in countries with inequality will have less access to quality goods/services. Extreme inequality can cause social unrest.

#### Non-monetarized Economy

* LEDCs’ households are often quite self-sufficient, with a substantial portion of production (e.g. agricultural, childcare) never reaching the marketplace.
* These self-provided services increase standards of living but aren’t recorded.
* Non-marketed output is likely far greater in LEDCs that MEDCs where equivalents are recorded in the national income.
* **Non-marketed output** is the output of goods and services which aren’t sold in the market and don’t generate income.
* *Example*: Malawi.
* *Importance*: non-marketed output improve well being but aren’t recognized in GDP so standards of living are higher than GDP suggests.

#### Hidden/shadow Economy

* Many transactions are unrecorded as they aren’t declared to avoid taxes or because they are illegal.
* *Example*: this is 14.2% of the UK’s economy. In LICs, 37.3%. In emerging countries 27.9%.
* *Importance*: leads to underestimation of the true size of an economy. The government doesn’t collect tax which decreases standards of living.

#### Differing Domestic Price Levels

* The **purchasing power parity (PPP)** is an exchange rate which takes into account the cost of an identical basket of goods in each country. It helps increase accuracy when comparing standards of living in countries where goods/services cost different amounts.
* To compare GDP, it must be adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP) which takes into account the cost of living by comparing the cost of a basket of goods in different countries.
* *Example*: the USA has the highest GDP at $20.5 trillion, but when adjusted for PPP, China has the highest GDP.
* *Importance*: if PPP is strong (usually in LEDCs), people can reach their basic needs more easily which increases the standard of living.

#### Inflation

* **Inflation** is when money loses value over time as prices increase. This can cause GDP to increase even though standards of living stay the same.
* **Nominal GDP** is the value of this year’s output at current prices.
* **Real GDP** is GDP adjusted for inflation. It gives a more accurate measure of living standards as it considers changes in living costs (inflation).
* *Importance*: nominal GDP is likely higher than real GDP which makes it seem that living standards are higher than they actually are.

#### Population

* **GDP per capita** is $\frac{\text{total GDP}}{\text{population}}$. It is more useful when comparing living standards as it shows income per person.
* *Example*: China’s GDP is $17.7 trillion and the UK’s is $3.13 trillion, but because the UK has a much smaller population, the UK’s GDP per capita is $46,000 and China’s is $12,720.

#### Leisure time

* GDP doesn’t account for leisure time.
* *Example*: the USA’s GDP per capita is larger than Germany’s, but on average, workers in the USA work 25% more than in Germany.
* *Importance*: this impacts the quality of your life.

#### Problems of Data Collection

* Collecting all the different data is very complicated and techniques differ by country.
* Some countries are inefficient at collecting/calculating data so comparison can be less effective.
* *Importance*: this makes direct comparisons between countries’ GDP difficult.

#### Environment

* GDP doesn’t take into account the value of negative externalities such as pollution and other undesirable by-products of production which contribute to environmental degradation.
* GDP also doesn’t take into account the depletion of natural resources (e.g. rainforests, wildlife) which reduces society’s well-being.

### National Happiness

* The UN Happiness Report found six key factors which affect welfare:
    * Real GDP per capita
    * Life expectancy
    * Generosity
    * Social support (having someone to count on)
    * Perceived freedom to make life choices
    * Freedom from corruption
* A metric is **HDI** which aims to take into account the most important factors in development: income, life expectancy, and basic education.
* **Happiness economics** looks at how content individuals are with their lives. It has come about as standard measures of living standards don’t take into account contentment (i.e. money doesn’t buy happiness).
    * At low levels of income, increasing income usually increases happiness.
    * However, after certain income levels, there is a rapid diminishing marginal utility of wealth/income. This is called the **Easterlin Paradox**.
    * One study found that the threshold was $75,000 annual salary.
* *Example*: in 2010, the UK Prime Minister launched the Measuring National Wellbeing Report. Bhutan measures progress in Gross National Happiness rather than GDP.
