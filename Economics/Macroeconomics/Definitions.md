* **Labour** includes the physical and mental effort that people contribute to the production of goods and services.
* **(Physical) capital** is a man-made factor of production (i.e. it itself produced) used to produce goods and services.
* **Entrepreneurship** is a human skill possessed by some people, involving the ability to innovate by developing new ways of doing things, to take business risks, and to seek new opportunities for opening and running a business.
* **National output** is the total output of goods and services in the economy.

* **National expenditure** is the total level of spending in the economy.
* **Income** is a flow of money going to factors of production.
* **Wealth** is a stock concept that can be used to generate income. It is a large amount of money or valuable possessions.

## [Economic growth](Economic%20growth.md)

* **Economic growth** is an increase in the the real quantity of goods and services produced over a period of time (usually a year), or real GDP. It measures the rate of change of a country’s output.
* **GDP** is the total value of goods and services produced in a country within a year. It is the key measure of economic growth.
* **Short-run economic growth** is the actual annual percentage change in real national output.
* **Long-run economic growth** is an increase in the potential productive capacity of the economy.
* **GNI** is the value of goods and services produced by a country over a period of time plus net income paid into the country by other countries for things such as dividends and interest payments.
* **Non-marketed output** is the output of goods and services which aren’t sold in the market and don’t generate income.
* The **purchasing power parity (PPP)** is an exchange rate which takes into account the cost of an identical basket of goods in each country. It helps increase accuracy when comparing standards of living in countries where goods/services cost different amounts.
* **Inflation** is when money loses value over time as prices increase. This can cause GDP to increase even though standards of living stay the same.
* **Nominal GDP** is the value of this year’s output at current prices.
* **Real GDP** is GDP adjusted for inflation. It gives a more accurate measure of living standards as it considers changes in living costs (inflation).

## [The trade cycle](The%20trade%20cycle.md)

* The **trade cycle** is fluctuations in the growth of real output, consisting of alternating periods of expansion (increasing real output) and contraction.
* **Long term growth trend** or **potential growth** shows how output grows over time when cyclical fluctuations are removed.

## [Economic growth and efficiency](Economic%20growth%20and%20efficiency.md)

* **Productivity** is the quantity of output produced for each hour of work of the working population.
* **Actual growth** is the percentage change in GDP. It is when the economy is actually producing more goods and services.
* **Potential growth** is a change in the productive potential of the economy over time.
* The **value of GDP** is the monetary value of GDP at prices of the day. It is the nominal figure and is calculated by $\text{volume} \times \text{current price level}$.
* The **volume of GDP** is GDP adjusted for inflation.

## [Aggregate demand](Aggregate%20demand.md)

* **Aggregate demand** ($\text{AD}$) is the total quantity of aggregate output (or real GDP) that all buyers in an economy want to buy at different possible price levels, ceteris paribus.
* **Consumption** ($\text{C}$) is consumer spending on goods and services.
* **Investment** ($\text{I}$) is spending by firms on capital goods (e.g. new equipment and buildings) as well as working capital (e.g. stocks and work in progress).
* **Government spending** ($\text{G}$) is spending by the government on providing goods and services, generally *public* (non-rivalrous, non-excludable) and *merit* (rivalrous, excludable e.g. healthcare) goods, *wages* of public sector workers and *investment goods* (e.g. roads, schools). *Transfer payments* (e.g. pensions, jobseeker’s allowances) aren’t included.
* **Net exports** $(\text{X}-\text{M})$ is exports - imports. The UK has a large trade deficit but this is the least significant part of AD.
* The **aggregate demand curve** shows the relationship between the aggregate output buyers want to buy (i.e. real GDP demanded), and the economy’s price level, ceteris paribus.
* The **real balance effect** is when the price level decreases, so the purchasing power of income increases, leading to an expansion of AD.
* The **trade effect** is when the price level decreases, so a country exports more leading to increased export revenue and an expansion of AD.
* The **interest rate effect** is when price levels decrease, interest rates decrease to meet an inflation target. This stimulates investment and consumption causing an expansion of AD.

## [Consumption](Consumption.md)

* **Consumption** is the total planned spending by households on consumer goods and services produced within the economy.
* **Disposable income** (Y) is the money consumers have left to spend after taxes are taken and state benefits are added.
* **Saving** is the proportion of disposable income that is not used for consumption.
* **Marginal propensity to consume** is the willingness for households to spend any extra income that they earn.
* The **average propensity to consume** is the average amount spent on consumption out of total income.
* **Marginal propensity to save** is how much of an increase in income is saved.
* **Average propensity to save** is the average amount saved out of income.
* **Consumer confidence** is how optimistic consumers are about their future income and the economy’s future.
* **Interest rates** are the cost of borrowing and the reward for saving expressed as a percentage of the money saved/borrowed.
* **Inflation** is the sustained increase in the general price level.
* **Wealth** is a stock of assets.
* The **Household Saving Ratio** shows the proportion of household income that is saved.

## [Government spending](Government%20spending.md)

* **Current expenditure** is recurring spending (i.e. spending on items that are consumed and last for a limited period of time).
e.g. salary of gov. employees, provision of subsidies.
* **Capital expenditure** is spending on assets (i.e. purchasing items that will last and be used repeatedly in the provision of a good/service).
e.g. physical capital (roads, schools, hospitals), public investment.
* **Transfer payments** are payments by the government to vulnerable groups of people for the purpose of income redistribution.
* **Budget deficit** is if expenditure > tax revenue in a fiscal year (the gov. must borrow money).
* **Budget surplus** is if expenditure < tax revenue in a fiscal year.
* **National/public/government debt** is the total stock of debt over time (i.e. an accumulation of budget deficits minus surplus).
* **Fiscal policy** is the decisions about government spending and taxes. It depends on the government’s priorities.

## [Net exports](Net%20exports.md)

* The **exchange rate** is the price of one currency in terms of another.
* **Trade protectionism** is restrictions to free international trade imposed by governments.

## [Aggregate supply and SRAS](Aggregate%20supply%20and%20SRAS.md)

* **Short-run** is a period of time when prices of resources are roughly constant or inflexible (i.e. they don’t change in response to supply and demand). This applies especially to wages (the price of labor).
* **Long-run** is a period of time when the prices of all resources (inc. labour) are flexible and change along with changes in the price level.
* **Aggregate supply** is the total quantity of goods and services produced in an economy (i.e. real GDP) over a particular time period at different price levels.
* **SRAS** shows the relationship between the price level and the quantity of real output produced by firms when resource prices are inflexible.

## [SRAS shifts](SRAS%20shifts.md)

* **Cost-push** is when increased production cost is passed on to consumers.
* **Demand-pull** is when increased demand increases prices.
* A **supply shock** is an event with a sudden and strong impact on SRAS.

## [LRAS](LRAS.md)

* **LRAS** is a measure of a country’s potential output (the output at full employment).
* The **full employment level of output** is the level of real GDP at which the economy experiences full employment.
* **Full employment** doesn’t mean that all resources (inc. labour) are employed to the greatest possible extent, as there is still some unemployment, known as the **natural rate of unemployment**.

## [Classical and Keynesian AS](Classical%20and%20Keynesian%20AS.md)

* **Spare capacity** is unused physical capital (i.e. a negative output gap).

## [The multiplier](The%20multiplier.md)

* The **multiplier ratio** is the ratio of the rise in national income (i.e. rise in real GDP) to the initial rise in AD.
