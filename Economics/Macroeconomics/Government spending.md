* The justification for government expenditure includes the proposition that some goods will not be provided at all by a free market (known as public goods) whilst other goods will be underprovided (merit goods).
* Public goods are
    * Non rivalrous (i.e. using it doesn’t reduce availability).
    * Non excludable (i.e. anyone can access it).
* Merit goods include education, healthcare.
* Government expenditure can be categorized into either
    * **Current expenditure** is recurring spending (i.e. spending on items that are consumed and last for a limited period of time).
    e.g. salary of gov. employees, provision of subsidies.
    * **Capital expenditure** is spending on assets (i.e. purchasing items that will last and be used repeatedly in the provision of a good/service).
    e.g. physical capital (roads, schools, hospitals), public investment.
* **Transfer payments** are payments by the government to vulnerable groups of people for the purpose of income redistribution.
    * e.g. unemployment benefits, child allowances, pensions.
    * Transfer payments aren’t included in the government expenditure component of AD. This is because they represent the redistribution of income away from taxpayers, towards the receivers of transfer payments. They don’t represent new output being produced.
* **Budget deficit** is if expenditure > tax revenue in a fiscal year (the gov. must borrow money).
* **Budget surplus** is if expenditure < tax revenue in a fiscal year.
* **National/public/government debt** is the total stock of debt over time (i.e. an accumulation of budget deficits minus surplus).
