* **Demand** is the quantity of a good or service that people are willing and able to buy at any given price.
* **Utility** is happiness in consumption.
* A **rational consumer** maximises utility.
* A **rational firm** maximises profit.
* **Effective demand**: consumers must be willing and able to pay.
* As price decreases, quantity demanded increases. This is why the demand curve slopes downward.

> **Marginal** means ‘of the next unit’.

* **Marginal utility** is the benefit to the consumer of consuming the next unit.
* **Market demand** is the sum of the demands of each individual consumer (i.e. the sum of the quantity demanded from each consumer at each price level).
* **Derived demand** is the demand for a factor of production that results from the demand for the product that it is used to make.

## Types of Good

* For **normal goods**, as income increases, demand for the good increases.
* For **inferior goods**, as income increases, demand for the good decreases.
* For **Veblen goods**, as price decreases, the demand for the good decreases.

## The Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility

* As more of a product is consumed, the marginal benefit to the consumer falls.
* The rational consumer is willing to pay less for subsequent units as the marginal utility falls.
* Total utility *may* rise as consumption increases but marginal utility will fall.

## Determinants of Demand

* Price (inc. future price expectations).
* Income.
* Price of other goods.
* Tastes and preferences.
* Number of consumers.

> Changes in price lead to a movement along the curve.
> Changes in any other factors leads to a shift of the curve.

* Price change of a substitute good (e.g. chicken for beef) will lead to a shift of the demand curve in the opposite direction.
* Price change of a complementary good (e.g. gin for tonic) will lead to a shift of the demand curve in the same direction.
