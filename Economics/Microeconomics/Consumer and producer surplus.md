* **Consumer surplus** is the extra satisfaction/utility gained by consumers from paying a price that is lower than that which they are prepared to pay.
* **Producer surplus** is the extra revenue gained at market prices above that they were willing and able to supply at lower prices.
* **Marginal private benefit (MPB)** is the same as demand.
* **Marginal private cost (MPC)** is the same as supply.
* Where the MPB of consumers matches the MPC of firms you have market clearing price.
* **Paraeto optimality** is when one person canâ€™t be made better off without making another worse off.
* Where MPB = MSB (marginal social benefit) and MPC = MSC (marginal social cost), you have the socially efficient level output output, paraeto optimality, and allocative efficiency.
* **Community surplus** is consumer surplus + producer surplus.
