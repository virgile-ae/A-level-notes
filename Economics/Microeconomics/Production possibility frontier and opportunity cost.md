## Production Possibility Frontier/Curve

### 3 Key Economic Questions

* What to produce.
* Who to produce it for.
* How to make it.

These are decided based on demand.

![Increasing opportunity cost (as the amount you are sacrificing for what you make is increasing). This is due to the Law of Diminishing Marginal Returns.](Economics/Microeconomics/Production%20possibility%20frontier%20and%20opportunity%20cost/Untitled.png)

Increasing opportunity cost (as the amount you are sacrificing for what you make is increasing). This is due to the Law of Diminishing Marginal Returns.

![Constant opportunity cost (as the amount of gain for the amount of cost is constant).](Economics/Microeconomics/Production%20possibility%20frontier%20and%20opportunity%20cost/Untitled%201.png)

Constant opportunity cost (as the amount of gain for the amount of cost is constant).

* In microeconomics, the PPF graph compares 2 goods.
* In macroeconomics, the PPF graph compares 2 groups of goods (usually capital and consumer).

The **PPF** represents all combinations of the maximum amounts of 2 goods that can be produced in an economy, given its resources and technology, when there is full employment and productive efficiency (i.e. full use of the 4 factors of production).

* **Productive efficiency** is reached when resources are used in the best possible way, and output is produced using the fewest possible resources or the lowest possible cost.
* **Allocative efficiency** is the point on the PPF where society’s needs are met.
* ************Pareto optimality************ is when a country’s production is on the PPF.
* All points on the PPF are productively efficient, but only one is allocatively efficient.

If an economy operates within the PPF, there are *unemployed resources* but there is *no opportunity cost involved in increasing output*.

The government will try to reach the PPF as it will increase its income (due to tax).

## Shifting the PPF

Increase in the PPF (when it shifts outwards) indicates (long-term) potential growth and is caused by:

* Increased quality of factors of production.
* Increased quantity of factors of production.
* Increased efficiency of factors of production.

An inward shift indicates a reduction in productive potential. This can be caused by:

* War/conflict
* Disease
* Natural disaster

## Scarcity

* An economy can’t produce outside its PPF as it has a limited quantity of resources and technology.
* Scarcity forces economics to make choices about how much of each good to produce.
* Choice involves opportunity cost.
