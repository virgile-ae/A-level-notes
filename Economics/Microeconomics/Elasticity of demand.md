* **Elasticity** looks at responsiveness to change.

## Price Elasticity of Demand

* **Price elasticity (PED)** is the responsiveness of a change in quantity demanded to a change in price.
* $\text{PED}=\frac{\text{\% change in quantity demanded}}{\text{\% change in price}}$, which can be remembered as $\frac{\text{dinner}}{\text{plate}}$.
* PED is *always negative* as the demand curve is downwards sloping.
* **Price elastic** means that a change in price leads to a greater change in quantity demanded.
    * $\text{PED}>1$
    * Shallow demand curve.
    * When price increases, Qd decreases by a larger % so revenue decreases.
* **Price inelastic** means that a change in price leads to a smaller change in quantity demanded.
    * $\text{PED}<1$
    * Steep demand curve.
    * When price increases, Qd decreases by a larger % so revenue decreases.
* **Price unitary** means that the change in price is the same as the change in Qd.
    * $\text{PED}=1$
    * There is no change in revenue when price changes.
* **Perfectly elastic** means that $\text{PED}=\infin$, so the demand curve is horizontal.
* **Perfectly inelastic** means that $\text{PED}=0$, so the demand curve is vertical.
