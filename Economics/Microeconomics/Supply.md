* **Supply** is the willingness and ability of producers to produce a quantity of a good or service at each and every price level.
* The **law of supply** is that as the price of a product rises the quantity supplied will increase. It is upwards sloping (*supply to the sky*).
* Supply is inversely proportional to the cost of production (i.e. marginal private cost).
* Supply is the same as **marginal private cost**.

## Why Does Supply Curve upwards

* The **profit motive**: when market price rises following increased demand, it is more profitable for businesses to increase their output.
* **Diminishing marginal returns** and **increasing marginal cost**: (after an optimal level of capacity is reached) the return on each additional factor of production employed falls so the cost per unit rises.
* New entrants coming into the market: higher prices create incentive for other businesses to enter the market leading to an increase in total supply.

## Determinants of Supply

* Change in the costs of production
e.g. increased labor costs means a firm can supply less so the curve shifts left.
* Competitive supply: alternative products that a business could make with its factor resource of land, labour, and capital.
e.g. diversion of land used in supplying food to producing biofuels.
* Joint supply: change in supply of one good leads to the same change in supply of a byproduct.
e.g. expansion in beef production leads to rising market supply for beef hides.
* State of technology: improvements in technology leads to right shift.
* Government intervention
    * Taxes: left shift.
    * Subsidies: right shift.
