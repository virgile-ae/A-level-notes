## [Positive and normative](Positive%20and%20normative.md)

* **Economics** is a social science that seeks to analyze and describe the production, distribution, and consumption of resources and wealth. Economics looks at rationing resources (which tend to be scarce).
* **Ceteris paribus**: all other things remain equal.
* **Positive economics** is concerned with facts and is value free. Positive statements can be tested to be true or false.
* **Normative economics** is concerned with opinions or value-judgements. A normative statement is an expression that something is right or wrong.
* **Opportunity cost** is the next best alternative forgone.
* **Free goods** have no opportunity cost.
* **Economic goods** have an opportunity cost.

## [Production possibility frontier and opportunity cost](Production%20possibility%20frontier%20and%20opportunity%20cost.md)

* The **PPF** represents all combinations of the maximum amounts of 2 goods that can be produced in an economy, given its resources and technology, when there is full employment and productive efficiency (i.e. full use of the 4 factors of production).
* **Productive efficiency** is reached when resources are used in the best possible way, and output is produced using the fewest possible resources or the lowest possible cost.
* **Allocative efficiency** is the point on the PPF where society’s needs are met.
* ************Pareto optimality************ is when a country’s production is on the PPF.

## [Specialisation and division of labour](Specialisation%20and%20division%20of%20labour.md)

* **Specialisation** is the production of a limited range of goods by an individual or economy.
* **Division of labour** is when production is broken down into many separate tasks.

## [Demand](Demand.md)

* **Demand** is the quantity of a good or service that people are willing and able to buy at any given price.
* **Utility** is happiness in consumption.
* A **rational consumer** maximises utility.
* A **rational firm** maximises profit.
* **Effective demand**: consumers must be willing and able to pay.
* **Marginal** means ‘of the next unit’.
* **Marginal utility** is the benefit to the consumer of consuming the next unit.
* **Market demand** is the sum of the demands of each individual consumer (i.e. the sum of the quantity demanded from each consumer at each price level).
* **Derived demand** is the demand for a factor of production that results from the demand for the product that it is used to make.
* For **normal goods**, as income increases, demand for the good increases.
* For **inferior goods**, as income increases, demand for the good decreases.
* For **Veblen goods**, as price decreases, the demand for the good decreases.

## [Supply](Supply.md)

* **Supply** is the willingness and ability of producers to produce a quantity of a good or service at each and every price level.
* The **law of supply** is that as the price of a product rises the quantity supplied will increase. It is upwards sloping (*supply to the sky*).
* The **profit motive**: when market price rises following increased demand, it is more profitable for businesses to increase their output.
* **Diminishing marginal returns** and **increasing marginal cost**: (after an optimal level of capacity is reached) the return on each additional factor of production employed falls so the cost per unit rises.

## [Consumer and producer surplus](Consumer%20and%20producer%20surplus.md)

* **Consumer surplus** is the extra satisfaction/utility gained by consumers from paying a price that is lower than that which they are prepared to pay.
* **Producer surplus** is the extra revenue gained at market prices above that they were willing and able to supply at lower prices.
* **Marginal private benefit (MPB)** is the same as demand.
* **Marginal private cost (MPC)** is the same as supply.
* **Paraeto optimality** is when one person can’t be made better off without making another worse off.
* **Community surplus** is consumer surplus + producer surplus.

## [Elasticity of Demand](Elasticity%20of%20demand.md)

* **Price elasticity (PED)** is the responsiveness of a change in quantity demanded to a change in price.
* **Price elastic** means that a change in price leads to a greater change in quantity demanded.
* **Price inelastic** means that a change in price leads to a smaller change in quantity demanded.
* **Price unitary** means that the change in price is the same as the change in Qd.
* **Perfectly elastic** means that $\text{PED}=\infin$, so the demand curve is horizontal.
* **Perfectly inelastic** means that $\text{PED}=0$, so the demand curve is vertical.
