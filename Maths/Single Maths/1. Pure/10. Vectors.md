## 10.1 Vectors in 2 and 3 Dimensions

In Cartesian coordinates, the unit vectors along the axis are denoted by $\text{i}$, $\text{j}$, and $\text{k}$.
Any 2D vector can be written in the form $a\text{i} +b\text{j}$.
Any 3D vector can be written in the form $a\text{i} + b\text{j}+c\text{k}$.

## 10.2 Magnitude and Direction of Vectors

### Component Form

This is the way of representing vectors which we are used to: $(x, y)$.

#### From magnitude/direction Form

The components of a vector with magnitude $\lVert\vec{u}\rVert$ and direction $\theta$ are
$$
\left(\lVert \vec{u}\rVert\cos(\theta), \lVert\vec{u}\rVert\sin(\theta)\right)
$$

### Magnitude/direction Form

Vectors can also be represented using their magnitude $\lVert\vec{u}\rVert$ and direction $\theta$.

#### Finding Vector Magnitude

The magnitude of a vector $(a, b)$ is
$$\lVert(a,b)\rVert=\sqrt{a^2+b^2}$$

#### Finding Vector Direction

The direction of a vector $(a, b)$ is
$$\theta=\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}a\right)$$

## 10.3 Operating on Vectors

### Addition

$$
(a, b) + (c, d)=(a+c, b+d)
$$

### Scalar Multiplication

$$
k(a, b)=(ka, kb)
$$

### Triangle Law of Vector addition

$$
\overrightarrow{AC} = \overrightarrow{AB} + \overrightarrow{BC}
$$

### Parallelogram Law of Vector addition (commutativity)

$$
\overrightarrow{AC} = \overrightarrow{AB} + \overrightarrow{BC} = \overrightarrow{BC} + \overrightarrow{AB}
$$

### Parallel Vectors

Parallel vectors are multiples of each other, so any parallel vectors, $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$, can be written as
$$\vec{a}=k\vec{b}$$

## 10.4 Position Vectors

### Distance between Two Points

#### In Two Dimensions

The distance $d$ between two points in two dimensions is
$$d^2=(x_1-x_2)^2+(y_1-y_2)^2$$

#### In Three Dimensions

The distance $d$ between two points in three dimensions is
$$d^2=(x_1-x_2)^2+(y_1-y_2)^2+(z_1-z_2)^2$$
