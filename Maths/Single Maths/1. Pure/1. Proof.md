## 1.1 Proofs

### Proof by Deduction

#### Example

Using completion of the square, prove that $n^2-6n+10$ is positive for all values of $n$.

**Proof**

$$
n^2-6n+10=(n-3)^2-9+10=(n-3)^2+1
$$

The minimum of $(n-3)^2$ is $0$, so the minimum of $(n-3)^2+1$ is $1$, therefore it is always positive.

### Proof by Exhaustion

#### Example

Given that $p$ is a prime number such that $3<p<25$, prove by exhaustion, that $(p-1)(p+1)$ is a multiple of $12$.

**Proof**

The possible values of $p$ are $5,7,11,13,17,19,23$.

For $5$, $4\cdot6=2\cdot12$.
For $7$, $6\cdot8=4\cdot12$.
â€¦
For $23$, $22\cdot 24=44 \cdot 12$.

Therefore $(p-1)(p+1)$ is always a multiple of 12.

### Disproof by Counter-example

#### Example

Show that the statement $n^2-n+1$ is a prime number for all values of $n$ is untrue.

**Proof**

For $n=1$, $n^2-n+1=1^2-1+1=1$, which is not prime, therefore $n^2-n+1$ is not a prime number for all values of $n$.
