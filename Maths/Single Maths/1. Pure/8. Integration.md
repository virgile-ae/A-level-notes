## 8.1 The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

* Integration is the reverse process of differentiation.
* For indefinite integrals, a constant of integration is required.

### Definitions

* **Derivative**: shows the sensitivity of change of a function’s output with respect to the input.
* **Integral/inverse derivative**: the area under the curve of a graph of a function.
* **Indefinite integral**: the inverse derivative of a differentiable function.
* **Definite integral**: the area under a curve between 2 points on that curve.
* **Constant of integration $(C)$**: this is the constant added to an antiderivative of a function to represent the term of the original expression which cannot be obtained from the antiderivative.

## 8.2 Integral Identities

(The ‘$+ \space C$’ is emitted from each of these for brevity.)

$\int x^n\cdot dx=\frac{1}{n+1}x^{n+1}$

$\int e^x\cdot dx=e^x$

$\int\frac1x\cdot dx=\ln|x|$

$\int\sin(x)=-\cos(x)$

$\int\cos(x)=\sin(x)$

$\int\sec^2(x)=\tan(x)$

$\int\cosec(x)\cot(x)=-\cosec(x)$

$\int\cosec^2(x)=-\cot(x)$

$\int\sec(x)\tan(x)=\sec(x)$

## 8.4 Using Integration as the Limit of a Sum

$$
\int_a^bf(x)dx=\lim_{\delta x\rightarrow0}\sum_{x=a}^bf(x)\delta x
$$

## 8.5 Reverse Chain Rule

$\int f(kx+c)dx=\frac1kF(kx+c)+C$
$\int\frac{f'(x)}{f(x)}dx=\ln|f(x)|+C$
$\int f'g(x)\cdot g'(x)dx=fg(x) +C$

### Special Cases

$\int f(x) f'(x)=\frac12 f(x)^2$

## 8.8 The Newton-Raphson Method

This method finds the tangent of a function at one point and uses the x intercept of the tangent as the next input.

$x_{n+1}=x_n-\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}$

This is derived from $m=f'(x)=\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=\frac{f(x_0)}{x_0-x_1}$, which we can rearrange into $x_1=x_0-\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}$ (the same as the above formula).

Below you can see the first iteration of the Newton-Raphson method to estimate the root of $y=(x-3)(x+4)$, with the initial value $x=4$.

### When Does This Method Fail?

* The starting point is a stationary point (i.e. $f'(x)=0$).
* The graph oscillates.
