## 3.1 Linear Equations

* $y=mx+c$
**Where**
    * $m$ is the gradient.
    * $c$ is the $y$ intercept.
* For parallel lines, $m'=m$.
* For perpendicular lines, $m'=-\frac1m$.

## 3.2 Circles

$(x-a)^2+(y-b)^2=r^2$

**Where**

* $(a, b)$ is the centre of the circle.
* $r$ is the radius of the circle.

Alternatively, a circle can have the equation $ax^2+bx+cy^2+dy=c$.

### Properties of Circles

* The tangent and the radius meet at a right angle.
* The perpendicular bisector of a chord goes through the center of the circle.
* A circumcircle can be drawn around any triangle.
* The circumcenter of the circumcircle can be found through at the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of the sides of the triangles.
* **Thales theorem**: the angle subtended from a diameter is 90**Â°.**
* The area of a triangle from its coordinates is

    $\frac12|x_1(y_2-y_3)+x_2(y_3-y_1)+x_3(y_1-y_2)|$.

## 3.3 Parametric Equations of Curves and Cartesian Forms

* Parametric equations have the form $x=p(t), \space y=q(t)$.
* The domain is the same as the domain of $p(t)$.
* The range is the same as the domain of $q(t)$.
